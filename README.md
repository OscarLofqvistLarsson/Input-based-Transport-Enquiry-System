## Introduction

Long queues and time-consuming processes at transport terminals for gathering information about available transport options are common challenges faced by commuters. The Voice-based Transport Enquiry System offers a modern solution to this problem by leveraging voice recognition technology to enable users to inquire about bus, train, or flight details through voice commands.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Users can interact with the system through spoken commands, eliminating the need for manual input.
- **Text-to-Speech Output:** The system generates responses in a voice-based format, providing commuters with convenient access to transport information.
- **Real-time Data:** Integrates with transport databases or APIs to fetch real-time information about available transport options, schedules, and routes.
- **User Authentication:** Implements user authentication mechanisms to ensure the security of the system and deliver personalized responses based on user preferences and history.
